# Observability Implementation Plan

This document outlines the gradual implementation of OpenTelemetry alongside the existing structlog setup.

## Strategy: Keep Both + Add OpenTelemetry Gradually

**Current State**: ✅ COMPLETED - Full observability stack implemented
**Goal**: Add OpenTelemetry for observability while maintaining structlog benefits

## Phase 1: Add OpenTelemetry Tracing ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ Instrument FastAPI endpoints automatically (`FastAPIInstrumentor.instrument_app()`)
- ✅ Add database operation tracing (`SQLAlchemyInstrumentor().instrument()`)
- ✅ Keep structlog for application logging

**Benefits:**
- Non-disruptive - structlog keeps working as-is
- Immediate value from request tracing
- Easy to remove OpenTelemetry if it's overkill

**Implementation details:**
- Console span exporter configured for development
- Automatic instrumentation of all FastAPI routes
- SQLAlchemy database queries traced automatically

## Phase 2: Correlate Logs with Traces ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ Configure structlog to include trace/span IDs (`_add_trace_context()` function)
- ✅ Your logs become searchable by trace context
- ✅ Unified observability experience

**Benefits:**
- Connect application logs to specific requests
- Better debugging with correlated context
- Enhanced troubleshooting capabilities

**Implementation details:**
- `_add_trace_context()` processor automatically adds trace_id and span_id to all log entries
- Works in both development (console) and production (JSON) logging modes
- Trace context included in all structlog output

## Phase 3: Add Metrics ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ Request duration, error rates, database query times
- ✅ Custom business metrics (features created, items processed, veto operations)
- ✅ Performance monitoring and alerting (Prometheus export)

**Benefits:**
- Comprehensive performance insights
- Proactive issue detection
- Business intelligence from application metrics

**Implementation details:**
- Prometheus metrics server running on port 8080/8081
- HTTP request metrics: duration, total requests, error counts
- Database metrics: query duration, active connections
- Business metrics: features/items created, veto operations, active counts
- All metrics exported in Prometheus format for monitoring/alerting

## Implementation Notes

- **Natural migration path**: Can consolidate to OpenTelemetry logging later if desired
- **Flexible approach**: Each phase adds value independently
- **Low risk**: Easy rollback at any phase
- **SAVT context**: Single-service application, good testing ground for observability
