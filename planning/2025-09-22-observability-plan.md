# Observability Implementation Plan

This document outlines the gradual implementation of OpenTelemetry alongside the existing structlog setup.

## Strategy: Keep Both + Add OpenTelemetry Gradually

**Current State**: structlog for application logging
**Goal**: Add OpenTelemetry for observability while maintaining structlog benefits

## Phase 1: Add OpenTelemetry Tracing

- Instrument FastAPI endpoints automatically
- Add database operation tracing
- Keep structlog for application logging

**Benefits:**
- Non-disruptive - structlog keeps working as-is
- Immediate value from request tracing
- Easy to remove OpenTelemetry if it's overkill

## Phase 2: Correlate Logs with Traces

- Configure structlog to include trace/span IDs
- Your logs become searchable by trace context
- Unified observability experience

**Benefits:**
- Connect application logs to specific requests
- Better debugging with correlated context
- Enhanced troubleshooting capabilities

## Phase 3: Add Metrics (Later)

- Request duration, error rates, database query times
- Custom business metrics (features created, items processed)
- Performance monitoring and alerting

**Benefits:**
- Comprehensive performance insights
- Proactive issue detection
- Business intelligence from application metrics

## Implementation Notes

- **Natural migration path**: Can consolidate to OpenTelemetry logging later if desired
- **Flexible approach**: Each phase adds value independently
- **Low risk**: Easy rollback at any phase
- **SAVT context**: Single-service application, good testing ground for observability
